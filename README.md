This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to undefined behavior when using raw pointers with vectors. The code modifies a vector's element through a raw pointer, but if the vector's capacity changes (e.g., due to further modifications), the raw pointer may become invalid and accessing it could cause unpredictable behavior, such as crashes or data corruption.  The solution shows a safer way to handle vector modification avoiding the use of raw pointers.
